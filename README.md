ðŸ‘‹ Hey there! Iâ€™m eLhashMIX, a curious coder and lifelong learner on a mission to turn ideas into reality through code. ðŸ’¡ Currently based in Algeria, Iâ€™m diving deep into the world of Java, embracing every challenge along the way.

ðŸš€ Right now, Iâ€™m:

Learning the ins and outs of Js ES6/Node/React, because every day is an opportunity for growth!
Building a Small Project that would be helpful hopefuly to everyone.
Exploring collaboration in the open-source community to share and grow together.
ðŸŒ± I believe in the power of community and the magic of mentorship. If youâ€™re passionate about tech, letâ€™s connect! Iâ€™d love to swap ideas and learn from each other.
